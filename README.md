2) Broke down the address information into individual columns, including Address, City, and State. This step facilitates better analysis and visualization of geographical data.
3) Calculated the profit percentage for each property with respect to its LandUse. This analysis provides insights into the profitability of different types of properties.
4) Standardized the values in the SoldAsVacant column, ensuring uniformity and clarity in the representation of vacant properties.
5) Computed the average selling price of houses based on the number of bedrooms. This analysis helps understand the pricing dynamics related to the number of bedrooms in a property.
6) Identified and calculated the top 10 owners who made the most profits from their property transactions. This information is valuable for understanding the most successful stakeholders in the Nashville housing market.
